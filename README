Asynchronous block copying tool.

This tool is useful when someone wants to copy data from one high throughput io but high latency device to another high latency device.

Possible situations when aioblkcopy can be useful:
1. Copying one iscsi drive to another.
2. Copying data to distant fiber channel device.
3. Copying data to LVM-based clustered mirror.

Copying data to/from any other block devices/files if that devices have high latency and io-request queueing capable.
